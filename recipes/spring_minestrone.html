    <h2 class="title">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="menu">
      <li>2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
      <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
      <li>1 medium leek, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>8 sprigs fresh thyme, tied together</li>
      <li>3 large red potatoes, chopped</li>
      <li>2 qt. lower-sodium vegetable or chicken broth</li>
      <li>1 bunch asparagus, sliced</li>
      <li>1 can (15 oz.) navy beans, rinsed and drained (optional)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp. chopped fresh dill</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="menu">
      <p>
        <li>
          Coarsely grind coriander seeds, fennel seeds, and peppercorns in spice
          mill or with mortar and pestle. Cook oil, garlic, and ground spices in
          a large saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until garlic is
          softened but not crisp, about 2 minutes. Add scallions, chile (if
          using), and lemon zest and cook, stirring occasionally, until
          scallions are softened and almost completely charred, 5â€“7 minutes.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Pour 6 cups cold water into saucepan, increase heat to medium-high,
          and bring to a simmer. Add leeks, fennel bulb and stalks, beans, and
          sugar snap peas (pan will look crowded but vegetables will shrink as
          they cook). Reduce heat to medium. Add a large pinch of salt and
          simmer, stirring occasionally, until leeks, fennel, and sugar snap
          peas are fork-tender, about 5 minutes. Add spinach, English peas, and
          miso and cook, stirring, just until spinach is wilted, about 10
          seconds; season with salt.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p><li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with fennel fronds.</li></p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Do Ahead: Soup can be made 1 day ahead. Transfer to an airtight
          container and chill.
